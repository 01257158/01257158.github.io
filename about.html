                Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by the world of technology and how it shapes our daily lives. 
                This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in computer science, where I am excited to learn and grow in this dynamic field.

                Although I am just starting my academic journey, 
                I have already gained foundational knowledge in programming languages such as Python and Java. 
                I am particularly interested in exploring data structures, algorithms, and web development as I progress through my studies. 
                One of my current projects involves creating a simple website to help new students navigate campus resources more efficiently.

                In addition to my coursework, I am an active member of the university's coding club. 
                Participating in club activities and attending workshops has allowed me to meet like-minded peers and 
                expand my understanding of various programming concepts. 
                I have also taken part in my first hackathon, which was an incredible learning experience and a lot of fun.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Outside of academics, I enjoy reading about the latest technological advancements and experimenting with small coding projects. 
                These hobbies not only fuel my passion for computer science but also keep me motivated to continue learning and improving my skills.
