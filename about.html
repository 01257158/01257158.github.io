                Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by the world of technology 
                and how it shapes our daily lives. 
                This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in computer science,
                in National Taiwan Ocean University, 
                where I am excited to learn and grow in this dynamic field.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although I am just starting my academic journey, 
                I have already gained foundational knowledge in programming languages such as C++. 
                I am particularly interested in exploring data structures, algorithms, 
                and web development as I progress through my studies. 
                One of my current projects involves creating a simple website to help 
                new students navigate campus resources more efficiently.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to my coursework, I am an active member of the university's coding club. 
                Participating in club activities and attending workshops has allowed me to meet like-minded peers and 
                expand my understanding of various programming concepts. 
                I have also taken part in my first hackathon,
                which was an incredible learning experience and a lot of fun.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Outside of academics, I enjoy reading about the latest technological advancements 
                and experimenting with small coding projects. 
                These hobbies not only fuel my passion for computer science but also keep me 
                motivated to continue learning and improving my skills.

                One of my favorite hobbies is watching Hololive VTuber streams. 
                Hololive is a well-known agency that features virtual YouTubers, or VTubers, 
                who use anime-style avatars to entertain their audience through various live streams. 
                These streams can include gaming, singing, chatting, and a variety of creative content, 
                making each stream unique and engaging.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The charm of Hololive lies in its diverse cast of VTubers, 
                each with their own distinct personality, style, and backstory. 
                Whether it's the energetic and mischievous antics of one VTuber or the calming and 
                soothing streams of another, there's always something captivating to watch. 
                I find myself drawn to their creativity and the way they interact with their fans, 
                creating a welcoming and inclusive community.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Watching Hololive VTuber streams is not just about the entertainment; 
                it's about the connection between the VTubers and their viewers. 
                The live chat interactions, spontaneous moments, and the sense of being part of 
                a larger fan community enhance the viewing experience. It's a wonderful way to unwind and 
                escape from the daily grind, immersing myself in a world of fun and creativity.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                In essence, watching Hololive VTuber streams is more than just a pastime for me; 
                it's a source of joy and a way to connect with others who appreciate this unique and 
                entertaining form of digital content.

                One of my favorite culinary delights is sushi. This traditional Japanese dish has captured my heart 
                and taste buds with its delicate balance of flavors and textures. 
                Sushi, with its combination of vinegared rice, fresh seafood, and various other ingredients, 
                offers a dining experience that is both unique and exquisite.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What I love most about sushi is its versatility. From the simplicity of nigiri, 
                where a slice of fresh fish is artfully placed atop a small bed of rice, 
                to the more elaborate maki rolls filled with a variety of ingredients, 
                each piece of sushi tells its own story. The freshness of the fish, the slight tang of the rice, 
                and the subtle hints of wasabi and soy sauce create a harmony of flavors that is truly unparalleled.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sushi also offers a wonderful social experience. Sharing a beautifully presented platter of sushi 
                with friends or family is a joy. It's a dish that encourages conversation and connection, 
                as we savor each bite and discuss our favorite flavors and combinations.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                In essence, my love for sushi goes beyond just enjoying a delicious meal. 
                It's about appreciating the artistry, the tradition, and the communal experience that sushi brings. 
                Every time I indulge in sushi, it feels like a special occasion, a celebration of flavors and 
                craftsmanship that never fails to delight.
